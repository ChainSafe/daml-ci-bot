## Development

### Local Development

For local development with webhook forwarding via smee.io:

```sh
# Start development server with smee.io
npm run dev
```

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Running Tests

```sh
# Run tests once
npm run test:run

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test
```

### Code Quality

```sh
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
npm run lint:fix

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline runs on every push and pull request and includes:

- **Code linting** with ESLint
- **Type checking** with TypeScript
- **Unit tests** with Vitest (14 tests, 96% coverage)
- **Build verification** 
- **Test coverage** reporting

## How it Works

The bot works by:

1. **Detecting PRs**: When a pull request is opened, the bot is triggered
2. **Adding Workflow**: It adds a temporary `daml-tests-bot.yml` workflow file to the PR branch
3. **Running Tests**: It dispatches the workflow to run Daml tests
4. **Monitoring**: It polls for completion and reports results
5. **Cleanup**: It removes the temporary workflow file

The workflow template is stored in `templates/workflows/daml-tests.yml` and includes:
- Java (Temurin 11) setup
- Daml SDK installation
- `daml test` execution
